# <p align=center>Entity Guide and Tutorial

This is a guide and tutorial for the Trenchbroom-to-Godot 4 plugin, [**Qodot**](https://github.com/QodotPlugin/Qodot/). In this guide we will cover everything I've learned about making Qodot Entity Classes and how to design your entire level in TrenchBroom so that all you need to do is press `Full Build` in Godot.

This guide assumes a **novice-to-intermediate** level of familiarity with [**Godot 4**](https://godotengine.org/), [**TrenchBroom**](https://trenchbroom.github.io/), and [**Blender**](https://www.blender.org/). You don't need to be masters of any of them, but you should know the basics before deep diving into this guide. In order to follow along it is assumed you are on the latest versions of all these programs.

With the fanfare and warnings out of the way, let's get right to it!
