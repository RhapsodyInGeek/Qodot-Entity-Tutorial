# Helpful Resources

### Godot and Qodot

> [**Official Qodot Discord**](https://discord.gg/c72WBuG)<br>
This is one of my frequent stomping grounds. If you've got questions on Qodot or Godot, we've got some extremely helpful community members who are generally happy to answer them. Be respectul and patient: we're all volunteers, doing this on our free time and out of a love for the community.

> [**RhapsodyInGeek's GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/RhapsodyInGeek?tab=repositories)<br>
I know you're viewing this from my Qodot-Entity-Tutorial repository but just as a reminder I often share a lot of my work on GitHub, most of it licensed under Creative Commons Zero. Not all of it can be dragged and dropped into your own projects and some things haven't been ported to Godot 4 yet, but hopefully you'll come away from them learning something new.

### TrenchBroom and Quake

> [**Dumptruck_ds's TrenchBroom Tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gONePWocbqA&list=PLgDKRPte5Y0AZ_K_PZbWbgBAEt5xf74aE)<br>
Some of these tutorials are a little bit dated as some features have changed a little, but overall these will teach you not only the fundamentals but get you acquainted with some of the more advanced techniques and improve your TrenchBroom workflow. You can also learn more about Quake map scripting, which might inspire some design patterns for your own game.

> [**Slipseer's TrenchBroom Tutorials**](https://www.youtube.com/@Slipseer)<br>
YouTube channel with some great tutorials. Not a lot on here, but what's here can definitely level up a novice mapper's skill set.

> [**Slipgate Sightseer**](https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?forums/)<br>
In my opinion, the premier Quake modding and mapping site. Easy to navigate layout. Run by the best in the business. Check it out, even if just to get inspired by all the possibilities with TrenchBroom mapping. It's not just a lot of brown blocks (though those are cool, too).

> [**id Software GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/orgs/id-Software/repositories?type=all)<br>
An incredible source for study. John Carmack began a trend a long while back of releasing the source code for id Software games, and this repository stretches as far back as _Wolfenstein 3D_. The most relevant repositories for you might be the Quake 1, 2, and 3 sources. Also provided are the Quake 1 QC files, the code for almost the entirety of the gameplay.

> [**Quake Mapping Discord**](https://discord.gg/f5Y99aM)<br>
Discord server where the best of the best hang out. If you have questions on Quake or TrenchBroom, mapping or modding, the people here can teach you everything you want to know about it.

### Useful Tools

> [**Aseprite**](https://www.aseprite.org/)<br>
The most important game dev tool you will ever purchase. It's a wonderful pixel paint program that trivializes sprite work and animation.

> [**Krita**](https://krita.org/en/)<br>
Free and open source paint application that serves really well as an Adobe Photoshop alternative. I use this for my higher res image assets and concept art.
